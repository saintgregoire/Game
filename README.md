# Rock-paper-scissors with Orс (Frontend project)
_Desktop version only_

A beloved game of rock-paper-scissors takes on a creative twist. In this version, your opponent is a fierce orc. Victory will be determined by luck and your intuition.

*The project was created by me as a practical task to consolidate knowledge of HTML, CSS, JavaScript*
